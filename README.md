# NYSE Holidays

Simple JSON file containing all of the published holidays for the NYSE, from 2025 to 2027

This is also hosted at pryazhen.com/nyse-holidays.json if you just want to curl a file for automation.

I did this mostly because I saw that there are places that are charging for this sort of API endpoint, which is mega cringe.

This information is public and should be completely free.
